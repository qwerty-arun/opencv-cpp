# ðŸ”¹ Practice Program List (Step-by-Step Learning Path)

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner (Basics of OpenCV)

- [x] Load, display, and save an image.
- [x] Convert to grayscale.
- [x] Resize and rotate an image.
- [x] Crop a region of interest (ROI).
- [x] Draw lines, circles, rectangles, and text on an image.
- [x] Blend two images (addWeighted).
- [x] Apply Gaussian blur, median blur.
- [x] Edge detection (Canny).
- [x] Print individual pixel values.
- [x] Split color image to BGR.
- [x] Flip images.

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (Image Processing)

- [ ] Histogram calculation and equalization.
- [ ] Thresholding (simple, adaptive, Otsu).
- [ ] Morphological operations (erosion, dilation, opening, closing).
- [ ] Detect and draw contours.
- [ ] Image pyramids (pyrUp, pyrDown).
- [ ] Perspective transform (warp image).
- [ ] Color detection using HSV (detect red, green, blue objects).

## ðŸ”µ Advanced (Computer Vision & Fun Projects)

- [ ] Face detection using Haar cascades.
- [ ] Eye detection.
- [ ] Real-time object tracking with color.
- [ ] Motion detection using frame differencing.
- [ ] Background subtraction (MOG2).
- [ ] Barcode/QR code detection.
- [ ] Simple Augmented Reality (overlay an image on detected marker).

## ðŸ”´ Projects

- [ ] Photo Editor App (crop, resize, filters, text).
- [ ] Virtual Painter (draw with finger using webcam & color detection).
- [ ] Face Mask Filter (overlay sunglasses/mask on face).
- [ ] Motion Detector (home surveillance mini project).
- [ ] Number Plate Detection (using contours + OCR if you like).
